              <span className="text-[#151583] text-[1.3rem] pr-2">ō</span> The
              Corona Quilt Project was initiated at the onset of the pandemic,
              in April 2020, as a global community initiative, to create
              opportunities for authentic individual expression and a sense of
              belonging and connection. Inspired by the poem “Weaving a New
              Quilt for Humanity”, people across the world were invited to
              process and express their experience, challenges and grief of the
              pandemic on a square piece of cloth, using the timeless wisdom of
              their hands. As a co-founder, I recruited a high-ownership team in
              India, engaging more than 50 organizations.To ensure diversity and
              inclusion, individuals and organizations from diverse sectors were
              invited–the disabled communities, organizations working with
              menstrual hygiene, schools, not-for-profits, public sector,
              minorities, and vulnerable communities.

              <span className="text-[#151583] text-[1.3rem] pr-2">ō</span> The
              Project emerged as a symbol of hope, dismantling the gloom of
              isolation–people came together in online sessions to create their
              individual squares. Children contained in one bedroom slums, an
              adult lost his mother making his square on a piece of his mother’s
              saree expressed their challenges and grief, and saw it become part
              of a bigger narrative. Gradually, 50,000+ people across the globe
              joined, from refugees in Syria to Bollywood celebrities, making it
              a great equalizer and, culminating into six public art
              installations across four Indian cities.The Project was based on
              small and fast prototyping, following the community's response. It
              upheld a polarity that women and minorities struggle with in
              India–of having to choose between authentic expression and
              belonging. Ultimately, for me, it was about connection and being
              there for one’s community in the most challenging times.
